  conclusion: "The WhyChooseUs component has basic functionality working (video playback, text overlay, navigation) but fails to meet the key requirement of displaying with a 9:16 vertical aspect ratio. The component is showing a horizontal 16:9 ratio instead. Additionally, responsiveness needs improvement with proper use of relative units.",
  
  nextSteps: [
    "Fix carousel dimensions to achieve 9:16 aspect ratio",
    "Implement responsive units for better cross-device compatibility",
    "Verify video source detection in tests",
    "Re-run tests after fixes are implemented"
  ]

# Manual Testing Guide for Video Scaling Fix

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for manually verifying the video scaling fix for the Zero Risk card. The fix ensures the Zero Risk card maintains a 4:5 aspect ratio while other cards remain at 9:16, and the video content is properly displayed without clipping or distortion.

## Prerequisites
1. Ensure the development server is running (npm run dev)
2. Access the application at http://localhost:3001
3. Use browser developer tools for inspection
4. Test on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. Aspect Ratio Verification

#### 1.1 Zero Risk Card Aspect Ratio (4:5)
**Steps:**
1. Navigate to the Why Choose Us section
2. Locate the Zero Risk card (first card with video)
3. Open browser developer tools
4. Inspect the card element (.carousel-card-zero-risk)
5. Check the computed dimensions in the Elements panel

**Expected Results:**
- Width and height should maintain a 4:5 aspect ratio (0.8)
- CSS aspect-ratio property should be set to "4/5"
- Card should appear wider and shorter than other cards

**Verification Points:**
- [ ] Card dimensions follow 4:5 aspect ratio
- [ ] CSS aspect-ratio property is correctly applied
- [ ] Visual appearance matches expected 4:5 ratio

#### 1.2 Standard Cards Aspect Ratio (9:16)
**Steps:**
1. Navigate to the Why Choose Us section
2. Navigate to any non-Zero Risk card using carousel controls
3. Open browser developer tools
4. Inspect the card element (.carousel-card-standard)
5. Check the computed dimensions in the Elements panel

**Expected Results:**
- Width and height should maintain a 9:16 aspect ratio (0.5625)
- CSS aspect-ratio property should be set to "9/16"
- Cards should appear taller and narrower than Zero Risk card

**Verification Points:**
- [ ] Card dimensions follow 9:16 aspect ratio
- [ ] CSS aspect-ratio property is correctly applied
- [ ] Visual appearance matches expected 9:16 ratio

### 2. Video Display Verification

#### 2.1 Video Content Visibility
**Steps:**
1. Navigate to the Zero Risk card
2. Observe the video content
3. Check if the entire video is visible without clipping

**Expected Results:**
- Video content should be fully visible
- No part of the video should be cut off
- Video should maintain its original proportions

**Verification Points:**
- [ ] Video content is fully visible
- [ ] No clipping or cropping of video content
- [ ] Video maintains original proportions

#### 2.2 Video Object Fit
**Steps:**
1. Right-click on the video element and select "Inspect"
2. Check the CSS object-fit property

**Expected Results:**
- object-fit property should be set to "contain"
- Video should be scaled to fit within its container
- No distortion or stretching of video content

**Verification Points:**
- [ ] object-fit is set to "contain"
- [ ] Video scales properly within container
- [ ] No distortion or stretching

#### 2.3 Video Centering
**Steps:**
1. Observe the video positioning within its container
2. Check if the video is centered both horizontally and vertically

**Expected Results:**
- Video should be centered within its container
- Equal spacing on all sides if aspect ratios differ

**Verification Points:**
- [ ] Video is horizontally centered
- [ ] Video is vertically centered
- [ ] Equal spacing around video if needed

### 3. Responsive Design Verification

#### 3.1 Mobile View (<768px)
**Steps:**
1. Open browser developer tools
2. Toggle device emulation
3. Select a mobile device (e.g., iPhone 12 - 390x844)
4. Navigate to the Why Choose Us section
5. Observe the Zero Risk card dimensions

**Expected Results:**
- Card should use mobile dimensions (85vw width)
- Height should be calculated as width × 1.25 (4:5 ratio)
- Card should be appropriately sized for mobile screens

**Verification Points:**
- [ ] Card width is approximately 85% of viewport width
- [ ] Card height maintains 4:5 aspect ratio
- [ ] Card is properly sized for mobile viewing

#### 3.2 Tablet View (768px-1024px)
**Steps:**
1. In device emulation, select a tablet device (e.g., iPad - 768x1024)
2. Navigate to the Why Choose Us section
3. Observe the Zero Risk card dimensions

**Expected Results:**
- Card should use tablet dimensions (45vw width)
- Height should be calculated as width × 1.25 (4:5 ratio)
- Card should be appropriately sized for tablet screens

**Verification Points:**
- [ ] Card width is approximately 45% of viewport width
- [ ] Card height maintains 4:5 aspect ratio
- [ ] Card is properly sized for tablet viewing

#### 3.3 Desktop View (>1024px)
**Steps:**
1. Exit device emulation or select a desktop resolution
2. Navigate to the Why Choose Us section
3. Observe the Zero Risk card dimensions

**Expected Results:**
- Card should use desktop dimensions (30vw width)
- Height should be calculated as width × 1.25 (4:5 ratio)
- Card should be appropriately sized for desktop screens

**Verification Points:**
- [ ] Card width is approximately 30% of viewport width
- [ ] Card height maintains 4:5 aspect ratio
- [ ] Card is properly sized for desktop viewing

### 4. Functionality Verification

#### 4.1 Carousel Navigation
**Steps:**
1. Test the next/previous navigation buttons
2. Navigate to different cards and return to Zero Risk
3. Test clicking on cards directly

**Expected Results:**
- Navigation should work smoothly
- Zero Risk card should maintain its aspect ratio when active/inactive
- All cards should be accessible and functional

**Verification Points:**
- [ ] Next/previous buttons work correctly
- [ ] Direct card selection works
- [ ] Aspect ratios are maintained during navigation

#### 4.2 Text Readability
**Steps:**
1. Navigate to the Zero Risk card
2. Observe the text overlay on the video background
3. Check if text is clearly readable

**Expected Results:**
- Text should be clearly visible over the video
- Sufficient contrast between text and background
- Text shadows or overlays should enhance readability

**Verification Points:**
- [ ] Text is clearly visible
- [ ] Sufficient contrast with background
- [ ] Text shadows enhance readability

### 5. Cross-Browser Compatibility

- Video should display properly in all browsers

**Verification Points:**
- [ ] Consistent appearance in Chrome
- [ ] Consistent appearance in Firefox
- [ ] Consistent appearance in Safari

#### 5.2 Fallback Support
**Steps:**
1. Test in a browser that doesn't support aspect-ratio (if available)
2. Or simulate by disabling aspect-ratio support

**Expected Results:**
- Fallback heights should be applied
- Cards should still maintain correct proportions
- No layout breaks should occur

**Verification Points:**
- [ ] Fallback heights are applied
- [ ] Layout remains intact
- [ ] No visual regressions

1. Browser and version
2. Viewport size
3. Expected vs. actual behavior
4. Screenshots if visual issues
5. Steps to reproduce
6. Any console errors

## Additional Notes

- The Zero Risk card should visually stand out from other cards due to its different aspect ratio
- Video content should load and play automatically when the card is visible
- The implementation should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes
- Performance should not be significantly impacted by the aspect ratio fix

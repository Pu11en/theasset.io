## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us privately before disclosing it publicly.

**Email:** security@theassetstudio.com

Please include the following information in your report:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Any proof-of-concept code or screenshots (if applicable)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Detailed Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: Based on severity and complexity

### What to Expect

1. **Confirmation**: We'll acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
2. **Validation**: We'll validate and assess the vulnerability
3. **Resolution**: We'll work on a fix and coordinate disclosure
4. **Recognition**: We'll credit you in our security advisories (with your permission)

### Security Awards

We appreciate responsible disclosure and may offer recognition or rewards for significant security discoveries, depending on the severity and impact.

## üîí Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**
   ```bash
   npm audit
   npm audit fix
   ```

2. **Use Environment Variables for Sensitive Data**
   ```typescript
   // Never hardcode sensitive information
   const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
   ```

3. **Implement Proper Input Validation**
   ```typescript
   // Validate user inputs
   const sanitizedInput = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);
   ```

4. **Use HTTPS in Production**
   - Ensure all API calls use HTTPS
   - Implement proper SSL certificates

5. **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)**
   ```html
   <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'">
   ```

### For Users

1. **Keep Software Updated**
   - Regular updates include security patches
   - Enable automatic updates when possible

2. **Use Strong Authentication**
   - Implement strong password policies
   - Use multi-factor authentication when available

3. **Monitor Access Logs**
   - Regularly review access logs
   - Investigate suspicious activities

4. **Regular Security Audits**
   - Conduct periodic security assessments
   - Review permissions and access controls

## üì¶ Dependency Management

### Vulnerability Scanning

We regularly scan our dependencies for known vulnerabilities:

```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Fix automatically when possible
npm audit fix

# Manual review of vulnerabilities
npm audit --json
```

### Dependency Updates

- **Automatic Updates**: Minor and patch versions
- **Manual Review**: Major versions and breaking changes
- **Security Patches**: Immediate updates for critical vulnerabilities

### Third-Party Services

We use the following third-party services:

| Service | Purpose | Security Measures |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| YouTube | Video embedding | HTTPS, iframe sandbox |
| Vercel/Netlify | Hosting | SSL, DDoS protection |
| Google Analytics | Analytics (future) | HTTPS, data anonymization |

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Current Security Measures

1. **Client-Side Security**
   - Input sanitization for user inputs
   - XSS prevention through proper escaping
   - Secure iframe embedding for YouTube videos

2. **Network Security**
   - HTTPS enforcement in production
   - Secure cookie handling
   - CORS policy configuration

3. **Data Protection**
   - No sensitive data stored client-side
   - Minimal data collection
   - Privacy-focused analytics (when implemented)

### Potential Security Risks

1. **Third-Party Dependencies**
   - Regular security audits required
   - Dependency monitoring for vulnerabilities

2. **Client-Side Code**
   - Code is publicly visible
   - No sensitive information in client code

3. **External Services**
   - YouTube embedding requires proper configuration
   - Future API integrations need security review

### Recommended Security Enhancements

1. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
   ```html
   <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" 
         content="default-src 'self'; 
                 script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://www.youtube.com;
                 style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
                 img-src 'self' data: https:;
                 media-src 'self' https://www.youtube.com;
                 connect-src 'self';">
   ```

2. **Subresource Integrity (SRI)**
   ```html
   <script src="https://example.com/script.js" 
           integrity="sha384-..." 
           crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
   ```

3. **Security Headers**
   ```javascript
   // next.config.ts
   module.exports = {
     async headers() {
       return [
         {
           source: '/(.*)',
           headers: [
             {
               key: 'X-Frame-Options',
               value: 'DENY',
             },
             {
               key: 'X-Content-Type-Options',
               value: 'nosniff',
             },
             {
               key: 'Referrer-Policy',
               value: 'origin-when-cross-origin',
             },
           ],
         },
       ]
     },
   }
   ```

## üö® Incident Response
